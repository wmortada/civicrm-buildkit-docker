# CiviCRM buildkit on Docker

CiviCRM buildkit on Docker is primarily built for development. It may also be useful for hosting. Contributions welcome.

The **CiviCRM Dockerfile** ([`civicrm/Dockerfile`](civicrm/Dockerfile)) in this repo is published on Docker hub at <https://hub.docker.com/r/michaelmcandrew/civicrm/>. It is designed to work with a MySQL compatible container. You may wish to use it with other containers like `phpmyadmin` and `maildev`.

The **docker-compose.yml** file in this repository is a good starting point for Docker development. Advanced users may wish to create their own `docker-compose.yml`.

## Requirements

* Docker
* Docker compose

## Getting started

1. Clone this repository
2. From the repository root, run `docker-compose up -d` to start the containers
3. Create a dmaster demo site with `docker-compose exec -u buildkit civicrm civibuild create dmaster --url http://localhost:8080`

    * The build will run for some time (go get some coffee).  If successful, it will conclude with output similar to the following:

        ```
        - CMS_ROOT: /buildkit/build/dmaster
        - CMS_URL: http://localhost:8080
        - CMS_DB_DSN: mysql://dmastercms_rftpp:Z8ADa62aJjf6n7IX@mysql:3306/dmastercms_rftpp?new_link=true
        - CIVI_DB_DSN: mysql://dmasterciv_6o62j:zhp2ftwJuw5W4WpG@mysql:3306/dmasterciv_6o62j?new_link=true
        - TEST_DB_DSN: mysql://dmastertes_gdc1v:eGCi5IT2bIkKv4EZ@mysql:3306/dmastertes_gdc1v?new_link=true
        - ADMIN_USER: admin
        - ADMIN_PASS: ##########
        - DEMO_USER: demo
        - DEMO_PASS: demo
        ```

    * Make note of the admin and demo credentials for future use. These credentials may also be found in the build directory, e.g. the credentials for `dmaster` are in `build/dmaster.sh`.
    * For more help with civibuild's create command, see the [buildkit documentation](https://docs.civicrm.org/dev/en/latest/tools/civibuild/)

4. Navigate to your new CiviCRM development site at <http://localhost:8080>

Note: for less surprises, consider using a [stable release](https://github.com/michaelmcandrew/civicrm-buildkit-docker/releases).

## Usage

### CLI commands

Buildkit cli commands can be run from the host with:

`docker-compose exec -u buildkit civicrm <COMMAND>`

Alternatively, you can login to the container and run commands from there with:

`docker-compose exec -u buildkit civicrm bash`

Note: to avoid permissions issues, ensure that you connect to the containers as the buildkit user, not as root.

### The `/buildkit/build` mount

The `build` directory of this repository is mounted into the civicrm container at `/buildkit/build`. Builds created in the container are visible here, so files can be edited directly on the host.

### The `/extra` mount

We also mount an the `extra` directory of this repository at `/extra` for ad hoc use.

### Multiple builds and site URLs

In the Getting started example above, the URL has been explicitly set as <http://localhost:8080>. By default, new builds created with this Docker image are created at `http://[SITE_NAME].buildkit:8080`. This makes it simple to create multiple builds in the same container.

However you will need to manually create the `/etc/hosts` entries (or set up wildcard DNS) as the civicrm container is not able to access the host to do this for you.

### phpMyAdmin

phpMyAdmin is available for database admin at <http://localhost:8081>.

### Development email

Navigate to <http://localhost:8082> to view all email sent from the civicrm container.

Background: by default, buildkit disables outbound mail. We delete `civicrm-buildkit/app/civicrm.settings.d/100-mail.php` which re-enables outbound mail. We install `msmtp` on the `civicrm` container and configure it to deliver all mail to the `maildev` container.

### Aliases

docker-compose commands get quite verbose. You may want to create aliases as follows:

```bash
alias bku='docker-compose --file $HOME/civicrm-buildkit-docker/docker-compose.yml up -d'
alias bkc='docker-compose --file $HOME/civicrm-buildkit-docker/docker-compose.yml exec -u buildkit civicrm'
alias bkb='docker-compose --file $HOME/civicrm-buildkit-docker/docker-compose.yml exec -u buildkit civicrm bash'
alias bk='docker-compose --file $HOME/civicrm-buildkit-docker/docker-compose.yml'
```
You can then:

- bring up the containers with `bku`
- run build and admin tools with `bkc`, for example `bkc civibuild create dmaster`.
- start bash in the civicrm container with `bkb`.
- run any other docker compose command with `bk`, e.g. `bk down`

**Note**: the above aliases assume you have downloaded this repo to `$HOME/civicrm-buildkit-docker`. Please adjust as appropriate if you have downloaded it somewhere else.

### Using different versions of PHP

See [publish/README.md](publish/README.md) for instructions on how to build CiviCRM containers that use different versions of PHP.

### UID and GID conflicts

Bind mounts are fussy when it comes to user ids and group ids. If the user on your host machine has a different UID and GID to the buildkit user in the container (which is 1000 by default), you can create a custom build (see below) that passes BUILDKIT_UID and BUILDKIT_GID as arguments.

## Custom builds

This repository comes with a `docker-compose-build.yml` that can be used for custom builds. Custom builds are useful if you want to pass particular arguments to the build. For example, you can define the UID and GID of the buildkit user (see below).

You can create a custom build with a custom UID for the buildkit user as follows:

1. Overwrite `docker-compose.yml` with `docker-compose-build.yml`.
2. Change the BUILDKIT_UID argument to match your user id if necessary (`echo $UID` should give you your user id).
3. run `docker-compose up -d --build`.

## Getting help

Feel free to ask any questions you have on the [sysadmin](https://chat.civicrm.org/civicrm/channels/sysadmin) chatroom (mentioning @michaelmcandrew if you feel like it), or file an issue in the [github issue queue](https://github.com/michaelmcandrew/civicrm-buildkit-docker/issues).

## Upgrading

New docker images are periodically released on Docker Hub at <https://hub.docker.com/r/michaelmcandrew/civicrm/>. You can upgrade to the latest version as follows:

1. Download the latest image with `docker pull michaelmcandrew/civicrm`.
2. Run `docker-compose up -d` will rebuild your containers with the latest image.

**Note**: we mount `/buildkit` as a volume so that any changes you make to the civicrm container (and your bash history, etc.) persist across restarts. This volume is mounted over the `/buildkit` directory that comes with the container.  You will need to delete this volume (it gets recreated automatically based on the contents of the container) if you want to access the /buildkit directory that comes with the upgraded container. You can do that all follows:

From the civicrm-buildkit-docker directory:

1. Stop your containers `docker-compose down`.
2. Identify the /buildkit volume with `docker volume ls`. It will have a 'volume name' along the lines of `civicrmbuildkitdocker_buildkit`.
4. Remove the volume with `docker volume rm [VOLUME NAME]`.
5. Restart the containers with `docker-compose up -d`.

## Architecture

We stick with the defaults and follow best practice whenever possible. Sometimes CiviCRM best practice and Docker best practice are at odds. In these situations we are often forced to do things the CiviCRM way. When this happens, we make a note in the 'cloud native' project of the steps we could take to make CiviCRM more Docker friendly (e.g. environment variables to configure SMTP).

The `docker-compose.yml` defines the following containers:

* **civicrm** (serves the sites; contains build and admin tools like `civibuild`, `cv`, etc.)
* **mysql**
* **phpmyadmin** for easier MySQL admin
* **maildev** to catch outbound email

It seems like might make sense to integrate this repository with [civicrm-buildkit](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-buildkit) at some point. I don't think that would be too hard to do.
